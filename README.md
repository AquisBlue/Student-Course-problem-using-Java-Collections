# Student-Course-problem-using-Java-Collections
Aim is to use the concepts of java collections to perform add, delete and link records in hashmaps

Write a program to demonstrate the knowledge of students in working with Java collection framework.
Eg., Assume only a maximum of 3 courses can be registered by a student for week end semester classes.  
Create a hashmap ‘h1’ with ‘n’ key-value pairs where keys are the names of students and values are the courses registered by them. 
Create another hashmap ‘h2’ with ‘m’key-value pairs where keys are the names of courses offered for B.Tech and values are the names 
of faculty handling the courses. Write appropriate code to
-	Add or remove a student from h1
-	Iterate over the maps and display the key-value pairs stored in them
-	Given a student name, fetch the names of all those who teach him/her.

         Eg:, if the elements of h1 are
Stud name	Courses registered
A	        Python, maths, c
B	        c, c++
C         C++, physics,chemistry
And if the elements of h2 are
Course name	Faculty
Python	      111
Maths	        222
C	            333
C++	          444
Physics`	    555
Chemistry	    666

For the student “B”, faculty should be displayed as 333 and 444.
